            <h2>Introduction to PokéPath TD</h2>
            <p>Welcome to PokéPath TD, an exciting tower defense game where you strategically place Pokémon along enemy paths to defend against waves of opponents. This comprehensive guide will help you understand the core mechanics and develop winning strategies.</p>
            
            <h2>Understanding Game Mechanics</h2>
            <h3>Core Stats Explained</h3>
            <p>Every Pokémon in PokéPath TD has essential stats that determine their effectiveness:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Power:</strong> The base damage dealt by each attack. Higher power means more damage per hit.</li>
                <li><strong>Recharge:</strong> The time between attacks measured in seconds. Lower recharge times mean faster attack rates.</li>
                <li><strong>Critical:</strong> The percentage chance to deal critical damage, which typically doubles or triples normal damage.</li>
                <li><strong>Range:</strong> The maximum distance a Pokémon can attack enemies. Longer range allows Pokémon to hit enemies earlier.</li>
                <li><strong>Target Type:</strong> How the Pokémon selects targets (First, Area, Available, Random, etc.).</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Terrain Types and Placement</h3>
            <p>Understanding terrain is crucial for optimal Pokémon placement:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Field:</strong> The most common terrain type. Most Pokémon can be placed here without restrictions.</li>
                <li><strong>Grass:</strong> Some Pokémon gain power bonuses when placed in tall grass terrain.</li>
                <li><strong>Water:</strong> Water-type Pokémon excel here and may gain speed or power bonuses.</li>
                <li><strong>Mountain:</strong> Certain Pokémon gain range or power bonuses when placed on elevated terrain.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Building Your First Team</h2>
            <h3>Team Composition Basics</h3>
            <p>A well-balanced team should include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Single Target DPS:</strong> Pokémon with "First" targeting for consistent damage on priority enemies.</li>
                <li><strong>Area Damage:</strong> Pokémon with "Area" targeting to handle groups of enemies efficiently.</li>
                <li><strong>Support Pokémon:</strong> Pokémon with "Aura" abilities that buff nearby allies.</li>
                <li><strong>Specialists:</strong> Pokémon that can hit invisible enemies or break armor when needed.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Evolution Strategy</h3>
            <p>Pokémon evolve at specific levels, gaining significant stat improvements:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Focus on evolving key Pokémon to level 100 for maximum effectiveness.</li>
                <li>Evolution typically increases Power, reduces Recharge time, and improves Critical rates.</li>
                <li>Some Pokémon gain new abilities upon evolution.</li>
                <li>Plan your evolution path based on the route's difficulty and enemy types.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Essential Strategies for Success</h2>
            <h3>Early Game Tips</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Start with cost-effective Pokémon that provide good early-game coverage.</li>
                <li>Place Pokémon at strategic chokepoints where enemies must pass through.</li>
                <li>Balance your economy - don't overspend on expensive Pokémon too early.</li>
                <li>Use the DPS Calculator to compare Pokémon effectiveness before investing.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Mid to Late Game Tactics</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Upgrade your core team to higher levels and evolve key Pokémon.</li>
                <li>Adapt your team composition based on enemy types in each wave.</li>
                <li>Utilize terrain bonuses by placing compatible Pokémon on advantageous terrain.</li>
                <li>Consider held items to enhance your Pokémon's capabilities.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ignoring Terrain:</strong> Not utilizing terrain bonuses can significantly reduce your team's effectiveness.</li>
                <li><strong>Poor Placement:</strong> Placing Pokémon too close together or in suboptimal positions wastes their potential.</li>
                <li><strong>Over-investing Early:</strong> Spending too much on expensive Pokémon before establishing a solid foundation.</li>
                <li><strong>Ignoring Support:</strong> Neglecting Aura Pokémon that can significantly boost your team's overall damage.</li>
                <li><strong>Not Adapting:</strong> Failing to adjust your strategy based on enemy types and route characteristics.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Advanced Tips</h2>
            <h3>Optimizing Damage Output</h3>
            <p>To maximize your team's damage:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Combine single-target and area damage dealers for balanced coverage.</li>
                <li>Use critical hit abilities and items to boost damage significantly.</li>
                <li>Position Aura Pokémon to buff as many allies as possible.</li>
                <li>Time your upgrades and evolutions strategically during waves.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Route-Specific Strategies</h3>
            <p>Each route has unique challenges:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Study route guides to understand terrain types and enemy patterns.</li>
                <li>Prepare for boss fights by including Pokémon with armor-breaking abilities.</li>
