            <p>
                Welcome to <strong>PokéPath TD 1.2.5</strong>, the game that perfectly blends the nostalgic thrill of creature collection with the high-stakes tension of classic <a href="/wiki">tower defense</a>. In this strategic adventure, you aren't just building static towers—you are a trainer commanding a living, breathing team of <a href="/all-pokemon">Pokémon</a>. Your mission is to defend nine distinct <a href="/map-router">routes</a> from endless waves of wild Pokémon, but the twist lies in how you grow.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unlike traditional defense games where progress resets after every match, PokéPath TD offers <strong>persistent progression</strong>. The experience you gain, the levels you grind, and the evolutions you trigger stay with you forever. Whether you are actively micromanaging a boss fight against a Legendary Pokémon or using the <strong>Auto Mode</strong> to farm resources while AFK, every moment contributes to building your ultimate team.
            </p>

            <h2>Key Features of Version 1.2.5</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Live Evolution System:</strong> Your units don't just upgrade; they evolve. Watch your Charmander become a Charizard mid-battle, gaining massive stat boosts and new attack ranges.</li>
                <li><strong>"Roguelite" Progression:</strong> Defeat isn't the end. Even if a wave overwhelms you, you keep your caught Pokémon and experience, allowing you to return stronger than before.</li>
                <li><strong>Deep Strategic Combat:</strong> Utilize the <a href="/tools/enemy-counter">elemental chart</a>. Swap your team composition to counter specific enemy types (like using Electric types against Flying waves).</li>
                <li><strong>AFK Farming Mode:</strong> Respecting your time, the built-in Auto Mode allows you to grind levels and currency automatically, reducing the repetitive burden of RPGs.</li>
                <li><strong>Legendary Boss Battles:</strong> At the end of every route awaits a powerful <a href="/all-pokemon">Legendary Pokémon</a>. Only the most optimized strategies will take them down.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Game Manual: How to Play</h2>

                <li><strong>Lives (Hearts):</strong> The number of enemies allowed to leak through your defenses before Game Over.</li>
                <li><strong>Roster Bar:</strong> Shows your current team. You can drag and drop Pokémon from here onto the battlefield.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Strategy Guide: Tips for Advanced Trainers</h2>
            <p>
                To conquer the harder difficulties in version 1.2.5, you need more than just high levels. Follow these golden rules:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Don't Hoard Money:</strong> An unspent PokéDollar does zero damage. Always look to upgrade your active Pokémon or place new ones to cover blind spots.</li>
                <li><strong>Evolution is Key:</strong> Prioritize funneling XP into <a href="/all-pokemon">Pokémon</a> that are close to evolving. The power spike from a stage 1 to a stage 2 evolution is often greater than placing a second weak unit.</li>
                <li><strong>Variety is Strength:</strong> Don't fill your team with only Fire types. A balanced team (Water, Grass, Fire, Electric) ensures you never hit a wall against a specific enemy wave.</li>
                <li><strong>Secure Your Save:</strong> Since this is a browser game, always use the <strong>Menu -> Export Save</strong> feature to download a .txt backup of your progress, especially after a long grinding session.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
            <div class="faq-section">
                <h3>What is the difference between the Browser and Desktop versions?</h3>
                <p>The gameplay is identical. However, the browser version is more accessible but relies on your browser's cache for saving. We highly recommend manually exporting your save file often if you play on the web to prevent data loss.</p>

                <h3>How does the AFK Mode work?</h3>
                <p>Once you activate Auto Mode (Press 'A'), the game will automatically advance waves and your Pokémon will attack on their own. This is perfect for grinding XP on lower-level <a href="/map-router">routes</a> you have already cleared.</p>

                <h3>Can I lose my progress?</h3>
                <p>In the game itself, losing a battle does NOT lose your progress (levels/catches). However, if you clear your browser cookies, your save file might disappear. <strong>Always export your save data!</strong></p>

                <h3>Are there shiny Pokémon?</h3>
                <p>Yes! Just like the main series games, there is a chance to encounter Shiny Pokémon. Keep an eye out for them as they are rare and valuable collectors' items.</p>

            <h2>Controls and Hotkeys</h2>
            <p>Master these shortcuts to manage your team efficiently during fast-paced waves.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mouse Left Click:</strong> Place Tower / Select Unit / Navigate Menu</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>Advanced Strategy: Know Your Enemy</h2>
            <p>In version 1.3.3, enemies have evolved with special traits. Brute force will not always work:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Invisible Enemies:</strong> Cannot be targeted unless revealed by a specific tower ability or the Silph Scope item. Place a support tower with detection early in the path.</li>
                <li><strong>Armored Enemies:</strong> These take significantly reduced damage from Physical attacks. Use Special Attackers (Psychic, Fire, Electric types) to pierce their defenses.</li>
                <li><strong>Regenerator Enemies:</strong> These heal rapidly if not taking damage. Do not spread your damage; cluster your towers to burst them down instantly.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <h3>Can I evolve Pokémon during a battle?</h3>
            <p>Yes. Evolution is dynamic. When a Pokémon hits the level requirement mid-wave, a prompt will appear (or it happens automatically based on your settings), instantly healing them and boosting their stats.</p>

            <h3>How do I unlock Challenge Mode?</h3>
            <p>You must clear all 9 standard routes first. Once the credits roll, the Challenge tab will appear on the map selection screen.</p>

            <h3>Why can I not equip items on my Pokémon?</h3>
            <p>A Pokémon must be in your Inventory (Box) to change its gear. If the Pokémon is currently placed on the map, you must recall it first.</p>

            <h3>Is there a Shiny Hunting method?</h3>
            <p>Yes. Playing on Challenge Mode slightly increases the odds of encountering <a href="/wiki">Shiny Pokémon</a>, which often possess superior base stats.</p>

                    Have you ever imagined commanding a legion of Pokémon not just in turn-based combat, but as a fortified line of defense against endless waves? <strong>PokéPath TD 1.3.6</strong> turns that fantasy into a deep, tactical reality. This version represents the most polished iteration of the acclaimed fan game, smoothing out the rough edges of previous updates to deliver a flawless strategy experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unlike standard tower defense games where you reset after every loss, PokéPath TD offers a deeply satisfying <strong>Long-Term Progression System</strong>. Your towers are living creatures that gain EXP, evolve into powerful forms, and keep their stats permanently. In version 1.3.6, with critical bug fixes applied, the competitive balance is better than ever, rewarding skill and knowledge over exploits.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2>What is the Core Gameplay?</h2>
            <p>At its heart, PokéPath TD 1.3.6 blends the "Maze Building" logic of tower defense with the "Team Building" depth of an RPG.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Strategic Placement:</strong> You do not just build towers; you deploy Pokémon with specific elemental typings. Placing an Electric-type at a choke point to fry Flying enemies is key.</li>
                <li><strong>Live Evolution:</strong> Experience the thrill of mid-battle power spikes. As your Charmander defeats enemies, it evolves into Charmeleon right on the map, instantly increasing its range and damage.</li>
                <li><strong>Persistent Growth:</strong> Defeat is part of the journey. If a wave overwhelms you, you retain all experience gained and Pokémon caught. You return to the stage stronger, ready to crush what defeated you before.</li>
                <li><strong>Item Customization:</strong> Utilizing the system introduced in v1.3.3, you can equip <a href="/items">items</a> to your units. In 1.3.6, mechanics like "Curse" interacting with items have been fixed, making your loadout choices more impactful.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What is New in v1.3.6? (Patch Highlights)</h2>
            <p>While 1.3.3 brought the content, 1.3.6 brings the stability. Here is why this version is superior:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ditto Logic Fixed:</strong> Previously, <a href="/all-pokemon">Ditto</a> failed to copy the "Shiny" status of enemies. Now, it correctly transforms into Shiny versions, serving as both a powerful combatant and a visual trophy.</li>
                <li><strong>Curse Mechanic Patched:</strong> The interaction between the move "Curse" and damage-boosting items was broken. It has been recalculated to prevent game-breaking damage spikes, ensuring a fair challenge.</li>
                <li><strong>Draft Mode Integrity:</strong> A bug allowing players to keep Pokémon from Draft Mode has been patched, preserving the integrity of the roguelike challenge.</li>
                <li><strong>Localization Polish:</strong> Corrected naming errors (e.g., German "Cacturne") and UI text overlaps for a smoother global experience.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How to Play PokéPath TD 1.3.6: Your First-Time Guide</h2>
            <p>Welcome, Trainer. If you are new to the defense force, here is your crash course on survival.</p>

            <h3>1. The Objective</h3>
            <p>Prevent wild Pokémon from reaching the end of the route. You have a "Lives" counter (Hearts); if it hits zero, you lose the stage. But remember, you keep your EXP!</p>

            <h3>3. Understanding the HUD</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Wave Counter:</strong> Top center. Watch this to predict Boss Waves (usually every 10 levels).</li>
                <li><strong>Gold Reserve:</strong> Your currency for placing new units. Don't spend it all at once; save some for emergency upgrades!</li>
                <li><strong>The Box:</strong> On the side. This is your inventory. In 1.3.6, use the <strong>Name Filter</strong> to quickly find the specific counter-pick you need.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Mastering PokéPath TD: Advanced Strategy Guide</h2>
            <p>To conquer the Challenge Modes and Hall of Fame in v1.3.6, you need to think beyond simple type matchups.</p>

            <h3>Tactic 1: The "Economy of Leaks"</h3>
            <p>Novice players panic when one enemy gets past. Pro players understand that <strong>Health is a resource</strong>. Sometimes, it is better to let a weak enemy leak (losing 1 life) than to panic-spend 500 Gold on a tower you don't need. Save that Gold for a Tier-3 upgrade that will wipe out the Boss.</p>

            <h3>Tactic 2: Synergy Over Power</h3>
            <p>Don't just pick 6 Legendaries. A balanced team beats raw power. Combine a <strong><a href="/all-pokemon">Butterfree</a></strong> (Sleep Powder slows enemies down) with a <strong><a href="/all-pokemon">Snorlax</a></strong> (High damage Area of Effect). The slow effect keeps enemies inside Snorlax's attack range for longer, doubling your damage output effectively.</p>

            <h3>Tactic 3: The 1.3.6 Ghost Meta</h3>
            <p>With the Curse fix, <a href="/all-pokemon">Ghost-type Pokémon</a> are reliable. Use them to counter "Normal" and "Fighting" heavy waves, as they are immune to physical attacks from these types. Equip them with <em><a href="/items">Leftovers</a></em> to make them invincible lane holders against specific waves.</p>

            <h2>The Definitive Experience: Why You Belong Here</h2>
            <p>We believe gaming should be accessible, safe, and instant.</p>
            
            <h3>Reclaim Your Time</h3>

            <h3>Play with Confidence</h3>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
            
            <h3>Q: My save file from 1.2.5 isn't showing up.</h3>
            <p>A: Version 1.3+ introduced a new Multi-Slot save system. You may need to manually "Import" your old save text file via the Settings menu. Always backup your saves!</p>

            <h3>Q: Why is Ditto good now?</h3>
            <p>A: In 1.3.6, the bug that prevented <a href="/all-pokemon">Ditto</a> from copying the "Shiny" status is fixed. This means if you encounter a powerful Shiny enemy, your Ditto can transform into it, gaining its boosted stats and cool appearance.</p>

            <h3>Q: Can I play on Mobile?</h3>
            <p>A: While the game is built in HTML5, the interface is optimized for Mouse/Keyboard. It is playable on tablets, but a PC browser provides the best experience for micromanagement.</p>

            <h3>Q: Is there a speed-up button?</h3>
            <p>A: Yes! Once you are comfortable with your defense, press the "Speed Up" button in the UI (or check settings) to breeze through the early waves.</p>

                <p>
                    <strong>PokéPath TD 1.4.1</strong> represents a pivotal shift in user experience and tactical depth. While previous versions focused on adding content, Version 1.4.1 revolutionizes <em>how</em> you play. With a completely overhauled UI allowing for drag-and-drop team management and the ability to swap items mid-battle, the game feels smoother and faster than ever before.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But do not get too comfortable—the enemy has evolved too. This update introduces <strong><a href="/enemies">Boss Passive Abilities</a></strong> and three challenging new maps (Routes 1-4, 2-4, 3-4), demanding that you adapt your strategy or face defeat.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2>What is the Core Gameplay?</h2>
            <p>For those joining us in 1.4.1, the game combines the best of two worlds:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tower Defense Mechanics:</strong> Defend winding paths against waves of enemies using <a href="/all-pokemon">Pokémon</a> as your towers. Position matters—place Water types near fire lanes and Electric types at flying choke points.</li>
                <li><strong>RPG Progression:</strong> Your towers are not static. They gain EXP, level up, and evolve. A victory feels earned, but a defeat is just a lesson, as you retain your team's growth for the next run.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Major Changes in Version 1.4.1</h2>
            <p>This update is packed with features requested by the community:</p>
            
            <h3>1. Quality of Life (UI) Overhaul</h3>
            <p>Gone are the clunky menus. You can now <strong>Drag-and-Drop</strong> Pokémon in your party to rearrange their order instantly. Leveling up and equipping items can now be done directly from the main UI without digging through sub-menus.</p>

            <h3>2. Dynamic Item Management</h3>
            <p>In a massive strategic shift, 1.4.1 allows you to <strong>change <a href="/items">Held Items</a> during battle</strong>. Did a boss appear? Quickly swap your carry's <em><a href="/items">Lucky Egg</a></em> for a <em><a href="/items">Choice Band</a></em> to maximize damage instantly.</p>

            <h3>3. New Challenges</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>New Maps:</strong> <a href="/map-router">Routes 1-4, 2-4, and 3-4</a> have been unlocked, offering complex new pathing layouts.</li>
                <li><strong>Boss Passives:</strong> Bosses are no longer just big HP sponges. They now possess unique Passive Abilities (like damage reduction or status immunity) that require specific counters.</li>
                <li><strong>Ribbon System:</strong> Completing specific Challenge constraints now awards Ribbons, unlocking exclusive items and Pokémon variants.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. Expanded Arsenal</h3>
            <p>Discover <strong>28 New <a href="/items">Held Items</a></strong> and master <strong>10 New Abilities</strong>, expanding the total strategic combinations into the thousands.</p>

            <h2>How to Play: Controls & New Features</h2>
            <p>The control scheme has been updated to support the new UI features.</p>

            <h2>Mastering 1.4.1: Advanced Strategy Guide</h2>
            <p>With Boss Passives and dynamic items, the old "set and forget" strategies won't work.</p>

            <h3>Tactic 1: The "Hot-Swap" Technique</h3>
            <p>Since you can now change items mid-battle via the UI, use this to your advantage. Keep <em><a href="/items">Experience Shares</a></em> or <em><a href="/items">Lucky Eggs</a></em> equipped during easy waves to farm levels. The moment a Boss Wave notification appears, pause the game and swap everyone to combat gear (<em><a href="/items">Life Orb</a>, <a href="/items">Leftovers</a></em>). This maximizes efficiency without sacrificing power.</p>

            <h3>Tactic 2: Countering Boss Passives</h3>
            <p>Before deploying, check the Boss info. If a Boss has a "Thick Fat" passive (Fire/Ice resistance), do not rely on your <a href="/all-pokemon">Charizard</a>. Use the new Drag-and-Drop feature to move your Fighting or Electric types to the front of the line to deal effective damage.</p>

            <h3>Tactic 3: Ribbon Farming</h3>
            <p>Do not ignore the Challenges. The Ribbons earned from challenges like "Level Cap" or "Team Draft" are not just cosmetic—they often unlock high-tier items that are essential for beating the new <a href="/map-router">Route X-4 maps</a>.</p>

            <h2>The Definitive Experience: Why Play Here?</h2>
            
            <h3>Instant Access, No Friction</h3>
            <p>PokéPath TD 1.4.1 is a complex game, but accessing it shouldn't be. Our platform loads the game assets instantly via global CDNs, ensuring you spend time playing, not downloading updates.</p>

            <h3>Stable Save Environment</h3>
            <p>With the new Ribbon system, your save file is more valuable than ever. Our optimized container protects your local storage from accidental browser clearing better than generic game aggregator sites.</p>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>

            <h3>Q: Why can't I select the Polish language anymore?</h3>
            <p>A: In version 1.4.1, Polish language support has been temporarily disabled due to a text-rendering bug. It will likely return in a future patch.</p>

            <h3>Q: How do I unlock Routes 1-4, 2-4, and 3-4?</h3>
            <p>A: These are "Advanced Routes." You typically need to clear the standard versions of Route 1, 2, and 3 first. Check the map selection screen for specific unlock requirements.</p>

            <h3>Q: Can I change items on a Pokémon while it is attacking?</h3>
            <p>A: Yes! The new UI allows mid-battle swapping. However, the effect usually updates on the <em>next</em> attack cycle, so be quick!</p>

            <h3>Q: Where is the "Damage Numbers" setting?</h3>
            <p>A: It is in the Settings menu. For high-wave runs (Wave 100+), we highly recommend turning Damage Numbers OFF to prevent lag.</p>
