      title: '❓ Frequently Asked Questions',
      q1: 'Why are Pokémon organized by evolution families?',
      a1: 'Evolution families show the complete growth path of each Pokémon, from basic forms to their fully evolved level 100 variants. This helps you understand how your Pokémon will develop and what their final stats will be.',
      q2: 'What do the different stat values represent?',
      a2: 'Stats include HP (health), Attack (physical damage), Defense (physical resistance), Sp. Attack (special damage), Sp. Defense (special resistance), and Speed (turn order). Higher values indicate better performance in those areas.',
      q3: 'How do abilities affect gameplay?',
      a3: 'Abilities provide passive bonuses or special effects. Some increase damage output, others provide resistances, healing, or strategic advantages. Understanding abilities is crucial for building effective teams.',
      q4: 'Should I use level 100 Pokémon immediately?',
      a4: 'Level 100 Pokémon offer maximum stats but may be expensive to deploy. Consider using lower-level forms early in the game for cost efficiency, then upgrading to level 100 variants when you have sufficient resources.',
      q5: 'How do types affect team composition?',
      a5: 'Type advantages are crucial for damage effectiveness. Include a mix of types to cover weaknesses and exploit enemy vulnerabilities. The database shows type information to help you build well-rounded teams.',
      q6: 'How complete is this Pokémon database?',
      a6: 'Our database is the <strong>most comprehensive and accurate</strong> PokéPath TD Pokémon reference available. We cover <strong>every single Pokémon</strong> in the game, including all standard forms (#000-#102), Mega evolutions (M-Charizard X, M-Sceptile, M-Absol, M-Alakazam), and even <strong>hidden Pokémon</strong> that are rarely documented elsewhere. With over 100+ entries continuously updated, you\'ll find Pokémon that other databases miss, making this your definitive source for complete Pokémon information.',
      q7: 'What are hidden Pokémon and why are they important?',
      a7: 'Hidden Pokémon are rare or special forms that aren\'t always visible in standard game menus or other databases. These include Mega evolutions, special variants, and Pokémon with unique abilities like Carbink, Gholdengo, and various Mega forms. Understanding these hidden Pokémon is crucial for advanced team building, as they often provide unique strategic advantages that can make the difference between victory and defeat in challenging routes.',
      q8: 'How often is the Pokémon database updated?',
      a8: 'The database is <strong>regularly updated</strong> with the latest Pokémon additions, including newly released Pokémon like Sobble, Inteleon, Rowlet, Decidueye, Fuecoco, Skeledirge, and many others. We also update stat corrections, ability details, and add newly discovered hidden Pokémon as they\'re found. Our commitment is to maintain the <strong>most complete and up-to-date</strong> database, ensuring you always have access to the latest information for optimal gameplay.',
      q9: 'Why should I use this database over others?',
      a9: 'Unlike other databases that may be incomplete or outdated, ours is the <strong>most accurate and comprehensive</strong> resource available. We include <strong>all Pokémon</strong>, including hidden forms and Mega evolutions that other sources miss. Our data is verified, regularly updated, and organized for easy navigation.

      q1: 'What do the tier letters mean?',
      a1: 'S-Tier: Exceptional Pokémon that excel in most situations. A-Tier: Strong performers with few weaknesses. B-Tier: Solid choices for specific roles. C-Tier: Situational or niche picks. D-Tier: Generally not recommended due to significant drawbacks.',
      q2: 'Are tier lists objective?',
      a2: 'Tier lists are subjective and can vary based on playstyle, team composition, and game updates. Use them as guidelines rather than absolute rules. Community consensus helps identify strong performers.',
      q3: 'How often are tiers updated?',
      a3: 'Tiers are updated regularly based on new game patches, balance changes, and community feedback. Major updates may significantly shift rankings as new strategies emerge.',
      q4: 'Can I create my own tier list?',
      a4: 'Yes! This interactive tier list allows you to drag and drop Pokémon to create custom rankings. Save your preferred setup or experiment with different team compositions.',
      q5: 'Why are some Pokémon in multiple tiers?',
      a5: 'Pokémon can perform differently based on their level, team synergy, and the specific route or challenge. A Pokémon might be S-tier in some situations but C-tier in others.',
      q6: 'How do I know which tier is right for me?',
      a6: 'Consider your playstyle, available resources, and goals. Beginners might prefer A/B-tier Pokémon for reliability, while experienced players can experiment with higher-risk, higher-reward options.'
